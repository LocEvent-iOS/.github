## Introduction and Background

The LocEvent app project is here to address the issue or problem that raises among local travelers or tourists those who would like to find a certain event in their current city. Based on that problem, we found our goal which is how to find events easily in their current city. Even though the goal has been found, we cannot just move towards the solution finding without doing some more research. On this progress, we follow the challange-based learning (CBL) approach that consists of three steps which are engage, investigate, and act. The engage step has been done by finding the problem earlier. Next is investigate step where we refined our challange, identify the problem/oppurunity, and create solution for the matter. By those steps, we got more refined problem which is how to help domestic traveler to find comprehensive and detailed information on nearby entertaining events. By this problem, we come in with the solution of developing an iOS app that offers an integrated, complete, and realtime information.

Distance and ETA tend to be the main concern for event-seekers. Therefore, this feature will give them the idea on event's locations.
